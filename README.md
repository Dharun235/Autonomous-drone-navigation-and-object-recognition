# Project Overview
## Objective: Develop an autonomous drone navigation system that uses ORB SLAM for visual SLAM, YOLO for obstacle detection, and PID control for navigation in a simulated environment using Gazebo. The drone will navigate through a predefined environment, avoiding obstacles and reaching a target location.

## Prerequisites
ROS2: Ensure ROS2 is installed.
Gazebo: Make sure Gazebo is compatible with ROS2.
C++: For writing ROS2 nodes.
Pre-trained models: Use pre-trained ORB SLAM and YOLO models.
